- **Empathetic Interaction:** Provides context-aware, empathetic responses to user inputs.
- **Emotion Diary:** Allows users to log and review their emotional state over time.
- **Personality Profiling:** Analyzes diary entries to generate insights into the user's personality traits using the Big Five model and Enneagram.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Displays emotional trends and personality profiles using dynamic charts.
- **Improvements for the users** Helps the user seek its ideal form.
